# Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness

Previously, we learned about past and present attacks like the LoveLetter virus and the Morris worm, which helped shape the cybersecurity industry. One significant outcome was the establishment of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). In this reading, we will explore common attack methods and the evolving tactics and techniques used by threat actors.

## Phishing

Phishing uses digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

Common types of phishing attacks:

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Threat actor sends an email that seems to be from a known source to make a legitimate-seeming request for information, usually for financial gain.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targets a specific user or group. The email appears to originate from a trusted source.
- **Whaling**: A form of spear phishing targeting company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing**: Uses voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing**: Uses text messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or impersonating a known source.

## Malware

Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks, often to obtain money or intelligence.

Common types of malware attacks:

- **Viruses**: Malicious code that interferes with computer operations and damages data and software. Needs user initiation (e.g., opening a malicious attachment).
- **Worms**: Can self-replicate and spread across systems without user intervention.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts an organization's data and demands payment to restore access.
- **Spyware**: Gathers and sells information without consent, allowing access to personal data like emails, texts, and locations.

## Social Engineering

Social engineering exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables by creating false trust.

Common types of social engineering attacks:

- **Social Media Phishing**: Collects detailed information about the target from social media sites before initiating an attack.
- **Watering Hole Attack**: Attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB Baiting**: Leaves a malware-infected USB stick for someone to find and install, unknowingly infecting the network.
- **Physical Social Engineering**: Impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to gain unauthorized access to a physical location.

### Social Engineering Principles

Social engineering is effective because people are generally trusting and respect authority.

Reasons for its effectiveness:

- **Authority**: Impersonating individuals with power to exploit people's conditioned respect for authority.
- **Intimidation**: Using bullying tactics to persuade and intimidate victims.
- **Consensus/Social Proof**: Exploiting people's tendency to follow what they believe others are doing.
- **Scarcity**: Implying goods or services are in limited supply.
- **Familiarity**: Establishing a fake emotional connection to exploit users.
- **Trust**: Developing a relationship over time to gain personal information.
- **Urgency**: Persuading others to respond quickly without questioning.

## Key Takeaways

We discussed common attacks and their impacts, and why social engineering is so successful. This introduction is just the beginning; throughout the program, you'll further develop your understanding of identifying and defending against cybersecurity attacks.
