# Types of Attacks

## Password Attack

A password attack is an attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. Some forms of password attacks are:

- Brute force
- Rainbow table

Password attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

## Social Engineering Attack

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Some forms of social engineering attacks are:

- Phishing
- Smishing
- Vishing
- Spear phishing
- Whaling
- Social media phishing
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Watering hole attack
- USB (Universal Serial Bus) baiting
- Physical social engineering

Social engineering attacks are related to the security and risk management domain.

## Physical Attack

A physical attack is a security incident that affects not only digital but also physical environments. Some forms of physical attacks are:

- Malicious USB cable
- Malicious flash drive
- Card cloning and skimming

Physical attacks fall under the asset security domain.

## Adversarial Artificial Intelligence

[Adversarial artificial intelligence](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning) is a technique that manipulates AI and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. It falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains.

## Supply-Chain Attack

A supply-chain attack targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. These attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations.

## Cryptographic Attack

A cryptographic attack affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. Some forms of cryptographic attacks are:

- Birthday
- Collision
- Downgrade

Cryptographic attacks fall under the communication and network security domain.

# Key Takeaways

The CISSP security domains help fortify organizations against data breaches by preparing for various types of attacks. Data breaches can fall under one or more domains. Note that the methods of attack discussed here are just a few among many, and more types of attacks will be covered throughout the certificate program.
