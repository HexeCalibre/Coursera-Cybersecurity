# Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains

As threat actor tactics evolve, so do the roles of security professionals. Understanding core security concepts and organizing them into categories, called security domains, supports your growth in this field.

## CISSP Security Domains

As of 2022, CISSP defines eight domains that organize the work of security professionals. These domains are interconnected, and gaps in one can negatively affect the entire organization. Understanding these domains can help you identify your career goals and role within an organization.

In this section, we'll cover the first four domains: Security and Risk Management, Asset Security, Security Architecture and Engineering, and Communication and Network Security.
