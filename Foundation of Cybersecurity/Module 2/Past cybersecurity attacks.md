# Past cybersecurity attacks

## Key Terms

- **Computer Virus**: Malicious code designed to interfere with operations and cause damage. It attaches to programs or documents and spreads through networks.
- **Malware**: General term for software intended to harm devices or networks. Viruses are a type of malware.

## Early Malware Attacks

### Brain Virus (1986)

- **Creators**: Alvi brothers
- **Intention**: Track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses
- **Actual Impact**:
  - Infected computers using pirated software
  - Spread via infected disks to new computers
  - Slowed productivity and impacted business operations globally
- **Significance**: Highlighted the need for security and productivity plans

### Morris Worm (1988)

- **Creator**: Robert Morris
- **Purpose**: Assess the size of the internet by crawling and installing itself on other computers
- **Problem**:
  - Failed to track compromised computers
  - Re-installed repeatedly, causing memory depletion and crashes
- **Impact**:
  - Affected ~6,000 computers (10% of the internet)
  - Caused millions in damages due to disruptions and removal efforts
- **Significance**: Led to the establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTsÂ®)

## Importance for Security Analysts

- **Plan Development**: Understanding these attacks underscores the necessity of having security strategies to protect data and maintain productivity.
- **CERTs**: Learn about the core functions of CERTs and gain hands-on experience with detection and response tools.

## Conclusion

Early malware attacks like the Brain virus and Morris worm have significantly shaped the current security industry. As a security analyst, knowledge of these incidents can guide your approach to handling and investigating modern security threats.
