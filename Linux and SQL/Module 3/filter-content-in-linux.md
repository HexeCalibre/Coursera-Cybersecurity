# Filter content in Linux
In this reading, you’ll continue exploring Linux commands, which can help you filter for the information you need. You’ll learn a new Linux command, find, which can help you search files and directories for specific information.

## Filtering for information
You previously explored how filtering for information is an important skill for security analysts. **Filtering** is selecting data that match a certain condition. For example, if you had a virus in your system that only affected the `.txt` files, you could use filtering to find these files quickly. Filtering allows you to search based on specific criteria, such as file extension or a string of text.

## grep
The **grep** command searches a specified file and returns all lines in the file containing a specified string or text. The **grep** command commonly takes two arguments: a specific string to search for and a specific file to search through.

For example, entering **grep OS updates.txt** returns all lines containing **OS** in the **updates.txt** file. In this example, **OS** is the specific string to search for, and **updates.txt** is the specific file to search through.

Let’s look at another example: **grep error time_logs.txt**. Here grep is used to search for the text pattern. **error** is the term you are looking for in the **time_logs.txt** file. When you run this command, grep will scan the time_logs.txt file and print only the lines containing the word **error**.

## Piping
The pipe command is accessed using the pipe character (`|`). **Piping** sends the standard output of one command as standard input to another command for further processing. As a reminder, **standard output** is information returned by the OS through the shell, and **standard input** is information received by the OS via the command line. 

The pipe character (`|`) is located in various places on a keyboard. On many keyboards, it’s located on the same key as the backslash character (`\`). On some keyboards, the `|` can look different and have a small space through the middle of the line. If you can’t find the `|`, search online for its location on your particular keyboard. 

When used with `grep`, the pipe can help you find directories and files containing a specific word in their names. For example, `ls /home/analyst/reports | grep users` returns the file and directory names in the `reports` directory that contain `users`. Before the pipe, `ls` indicates to list the names of the files and directories in `reports`. Then, it sends this output to the command after the pipe. In this case, `grep users` returns all of the file or directory names containing `users` from the input it received.

> **Note:** Piping is a general form of redirection in Linux and can be used for multiple tasks other than filtering. You can think of piping as a general tool that you can use whenever you want the output of one command to become the input of another command.

## find
The `find` command searches for directories and files that meet specified criteria. There’s a wide range of criteria that can be specified with `find`. For example, you can search for files and directories that

- Contain a specific string in the name,

- Are a certain file size, or

- Were last modified within a certain time frame.

When using `find`, the first argument after `find` indicates where to start searching. For example, entering `find /home/analyst/projects` searches for everything starting at the `projects` directory. 

After this first argument, you need to indicate your criteria for the search. If you don’t include a specific search criteria with your second argument, your search will likely return a lot of directories and files. 

Specifying criteria involves options. **Options** modify the behavior of a command and commonly begin with a hyphen (`-`). 

## -name and -iname
One key criteria analysts might use with `find` is to find file or directory names that contain a specific string. The specific string you’re searching for must be entered in quotes after the `-name` or `-iname` options. The difference between these two options is that `-name` is case-sensitive, and `-iname` is not. 

For example, you might want to find all files in the projects directory that contain the word “log” in the file name. To do this, you’d enter `find /home/analyst/projects -name "*log*"`. You could also enter `find /home/analyst/projects -iname "*log*"`.

In these examples, the output would be all files in the `projects` directory that contain `log` surrounded by zero or more characters. The `"*log*"` portion of the command is the search criteria that indicates to search for the string “log”. When `-name` is the option, files with names that include `Log` or `LOG`, for example, wouldn’t be returned because this option is case-sensitive. However, they would be returned when `-iname` is the option.

> Note: An asterisk (*) is used as a wildcard to represent zero or more unknown characters.

## -mtime
Security analysts might also use find to `find` files or directories last modified within a certain time frame. The `-mtime` option can be used for this search. For example, entering `find /home/analyst/projects -mtime -3` returns all files and directories in the projects directory that have been modified within the past three days. 

The `-mtime` option search is based on days, so entering `-mtime +1` indicates all files or directories last modified more than one day ago, and entering `-mtime -1` indicates all files or directories last modified less than one day ago. 

> **Note:** The option `-mmin` can be used instead of `-mtime` if you want to base the search on minutes rather than days.

#### Key takeaways
> Filtering for information using Linux commands is an important skill for security analysts so that they can customize data to fit their needs. Three key Linux commands for this are `grep`, `piping` (`|`), and find. These commands can be used to navigate and filter for information in the file system.
