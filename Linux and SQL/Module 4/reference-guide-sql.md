# Reference guide: SQL
The SQL reference guide contains keywords for SQL queries. Security analysts can use these keywords to query databases and find data to support security-related decisions. The reference guide is divided into four different categories of SQL keywords for security-related tasks: 

- Query a database

- Apply filters to SQL queries

- Join tables

- Perform calculations

Within each category, commands are organized alphabetically.
