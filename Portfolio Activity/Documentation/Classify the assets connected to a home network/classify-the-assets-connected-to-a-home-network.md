# Classify the assets connected to a home network

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that **asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an **asset inventory**, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

## Scenario
Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

- Desktop or laptop computers

- Smartphones

- Smart home devices

- Game consoles

- Storage devices or servers

- Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

### Step-By-Step Instructions
Follow the instructions and answer the end-of-activity question to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

#### Step 1: Access the template

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select Use Template.

#### Step 2: Identify assets
In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the **Asset** column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the **Asset** column.

> ***Note:** A few devices, like a network router, desktop, and a guest smartphone have already been added for your reference.*

#### Step 3: Fill in the characteristics of each asset
List important characteristics, including **Network access**, **Owner**, and **Location** for each asset that you’ve identified.

Here’s an explanation of each characteristic: 

- **Network access** describes how often the device is connected to the network.

- **Owner** describes the person responsible for the device.

- **Location** describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

#### Step 4: Evaluate the access of network devices
Review the information that you’ve listed in the **Network access**, **Owner**, and **Location** columns.

In the **Notes** column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:

- *What kind of information is stored on the device?*

- *How does it connect to the network?*

- *Is the owner careful about securing it?*

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.

> ***Note:** Keep in mind that there might be some variation within each category. Try to identify details that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information that’s connected to the network.*

#### Step 5: Classify the sensitivity of network devices
It’s time to classify assets based on the information you’ve collected. Do this by thinking about how an asset could impact your business if its security was compromised:

- *What types of information would be disclosed or stolen?*

- *Could an attacker alter information on the device?*

- *What would happen to the business if this information were destroyed?*

For example, the network router is classified as confidential because the owner has granted limited access to the device to specific users.

Find the **Sensitivity** column in the asset inventory. Type one of the four levels of sensitivity you previously learned about.

> ***Note:** You can use the Categories table as a guide for choosing an appropriate classification.*

## What to Include in Your Response
Be sure to include the following elements in your completed activity: 

- List of 3 devices on the home network

- List network access, owner, and location for each device

- 1–2 notes on network access

- A sensitivity classification
