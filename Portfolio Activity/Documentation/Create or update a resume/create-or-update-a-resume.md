# Portfolio Activity: Create or update a resume

## Activity Overview
A **resume** is a document that you create and use to present your background, skills, and accomplishments to potential employers when applying for jobs. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prepare-for-cybersecurity-jobs/resources/ekICQ).

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario
Your resume gives potential employers a first impression of you and your qualifications. To prepare for your search for roles in cybersecurity, you will need to create a new resume or update your current one to reflect the skills and experiences you have gained from this program. First, you will search for and identify a target role. Then, as you craft your resume, you will tailor the content to match the requirements for that role.

> ***Note**: Crafting a strong resume is challenging and can take some time. For now, you should at least complete steps 1-6 of the activity, but feel free to finish the remainder of the steps later if you need more time. You will need to finish steps 1-9 to answer all of the questions at the end of this activity.* 

## Step-By-Step Instructions
Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 5 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Select a resume template
The formatting elements provided in a template—such as the layout and headings—are a helpful starting point when creating a new resume.

To select a template for your resume, open the [template gallery](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1&tgif=c) in Google Docs or another word processing application. Go to the resumes section and examine the templates. Choose one template for your resume, and open it. Rename the document “Resume [Your Name].”

Alternatively, if you already have a resume that you’d like to update, open that document instead.

### Step 2: Research cybersecurity roles
Think about what you’ve learned about cybersecurity roles in this program so far, and decide which type of role you would like to pursue. Consider the tasks and responsibilities that interest you, your current skill set, and your previous experience. Then, research roles on platforms like [Indeed](https://ph.indeed.com/?r=us), [LinkedIn™ Job Search](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), and/or [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com/regional_sites), and identify a position that appeals to you.

### Step 3: Take notes on your research
Add a blank page to the bottom of your resume document, or open a new document to take notes on your findings. Then, record the job title of the role you selected from your search, as well as some of the qualifications and skills required for that position. Read several additional job descriptions for similar roles to identify qualifications and skills that show up frequently, and note those as well.

### Step 4: Add your contact information
In the resume, add your contact information at the top of the document. Include the following information:

- **Your name**

- **Location** (such as city and state)

- **Phone number**

- **Email address**

- (Optional) the URL to your **LinkedIn profile**

Next, add a **job title** near your contact information that conveys both your current experience and the role you are seeking. For example, you might add “Incident Response Analyst” or “Data Forensics Analyst.” You can also add something more broad, such as “Cybersecurity Analyst.”

> **Pro tip**: Your email address should be easy to read, relatively short. It should also avoid too many words or symbols that are unrelated to your name. You may need to create a new email address if your current one doesn't fit these requirements.

### Step 5: Add your skills
Review the notes you took in **Step 3** to help you fill in the **Skills** section of your resume. Include skills  that align closely with the requirements for the position you identified. These might include skills you've learned in this program or ones you've gained in previous positions, such as:

- Python and data logging 

- Communicating with stakeholders

- Attention to detail

To organize this section, format your skills as a bulleted list in two or more columns. You can also split different types of skills into different sections, based on the requirements of the role.

> **Pro tip**: Match the language that was used by the potential employer when possible since some employers use automation software to filter resumes. For example, if the job description uses words like “problem-solving” and “critical thinking,” use those words in your resume, too.

### Step 6: Add your experience
The **Experience** section of your resume provides a summary of the positions you have held in your career. List **at least three** positions in reverse chronological order. This can include volunteer roles and other relevant experience. Each listing should include:

- Company name

- Location

- Job title

- Dates you worked there. (If you are still working there, write your start date, a hyphen, and then “Present.”)

- A short description or bulleted list of your responsibilities 

Focus on showcasing only your best and most relevant responsibilities or accomplishments. Your resume doesn’t need to include every detail from every job you've held. Once you get an interview, you can go into more details about yourself.

Follow these best practices when adding to your Experience descriptions:

- Use active verbs like *developed*, *coordinated*, *created*, *planned*, *built*, *tracked*, *managed*, and *monitored* to describe the tasks you performed. 

- When possible, quantify the tasks you performed by including numbers. (For example, “Collaborate with over 10 departments to ensure synchronization across the organization.”)

- Write in the present tense for work you still do, and use the past tense for a job or project that you completed. 

- Aim to communicate how your skills and past accomplishments relate to the role you are applying for.

### Step 7: Add your education
The **Education** section of your resume describes any formal schooling and training you’ve had. Listing your education helps demonstrate the qualifications and knowledge you bring to a potential employer and shows that you meet the requirements for the opportunity you are seeking. 

Fill in the name of any school you attended after high school; its location; the degree, diploma, or certificate you earned; and the dates that you attended. Begin with your most recent school first. Also, include any internships, apprenticeships, professional certifications, or credentials you hold. For example, you might include:

**Google Career Certificate in Cybersecurity** - Online certificate

MAY 20XX - OCTOBER 20XX

**Note**: If you’re currently enrolled in school and have not yet earned a degree or certification, write “In Progress” instead of the end date.

### Step 8: Add what makes you unique
Complete your resume with a section that further makes you stand out to potential employers. There are many approaches to communicating what makes you unique from other applicants.

For example, you can keep the existing **Awards** section (if using a Google Docs resume template) and list any awards you have received. Similar to the formatting used in Step 7, include who awarded them to you, and the date you received them.

Alternatively, you can replace this section with a section like “Languages,” “Software,” “Volunteer Work,” “Projects,” “Hobbies and Interests,” or “Accomplishments.”

> **Pro tip**: Tailor the section whenever possible to match unique characteristics of the role. For example, if the employer is seeking someone who is multilingual and you speak several languages, add a “Languages" section to highlight your skills.

### Step 9: Proofread your resume
It's critical to carefully proofread your resume for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. Correcting any mistakes demonstrates your attention to detail.

Make sure your resume is as concise as possible. Ideally, the length of your resume should be no more than one or two pages, particularly early on in your career. If there are places where you can use fewer words to say the same thing, choose a more precise word or concise phrasing.

> **Pro tip**: Closely read every section yourself or ask a friend to review your resume and provide feedback. Spelling and grammar checking tools are helpful, but they can miss mistakes.

## What to Include in Your Response
Be sure to address the following elements in your completed resume:

- Include your **contact information** at the top of your resume.

- List the **skills** you have that align most closely to the job posting.

- Detail your **work experience**, including each company name, location, your job title, the dates you worked there, and a description of your responsibilities.

- Detail your **education**, such as the name of the institution, its location, the credential you earned, and the dates you attended.

- List any **unique skills**, such as awards or other professional highlights.

- Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

- Be **1-2** pages long.
