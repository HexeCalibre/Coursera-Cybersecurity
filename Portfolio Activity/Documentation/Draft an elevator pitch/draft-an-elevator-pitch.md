# Activity: Draft an elevator pitch

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will research cybersecurity roles on a job search website and record notes on a position that interests you. Then, you will practice preparing to interview for that role by writing an elevator pitch. 

An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way. Elevator pitches are helpful for introducing yourself to career and business connections. They can be used in formal and informal ways. For example, meeting another security practitioner at an industry event or during a job interview.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

To create a strong elevator pitch, you need to consider how to present yourself as a suitable candidate for a specific role. Before you begin writing your pitch, you will determine what industry benefits you are looking for in a cybersecurity role. Then, you will research relevant roles on a job search website and identify one that appeals to you. Next, you will review the job description for the position and record key information about your relevant experience,  skills, and details about the company. After, you will write a 30- to 60-second elevator pitch using that information. Your elevator pitch will focus on describing yourself, your professional experience and skills, and why you are  an ideal candidate for the role. 

> **Note**: While this is a practice exercise and you won’t actually be applying for the role you’ve identified (unless you choose to), you can implement this process to search for relevant roles and draft corresponding elevator pitches in the future.

### Step 2: Determine your job search criteria
Before you begin writing an elevator pitch, you’ll need to determine what you are looking for in a job. Consider what you’ve learned about cybersecurity roles in this program so far and decide which type of role you would like to pursue. Also consider elements like:

- Tasks and responsibilities that interest you 

- Your current skill set

- Your experience level

- Your ideal location

- Your desired salary range

Add **at least 1** note on these criteria to the **Job Search Criteria** section of the elevator pitch template. 

### Step 3: Identify your target role
For your elevator pitch to be most effective, you’ll need to tailor it to each position you apply for. Begin by searching for roles on platforms like [indeed.com](https://ph.indeed.com/?r=us), [linkedin.com/jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), or [careerbuilder.com](https://www.careerbuilder.com/regional_sites). You can search for cybersecurity titles like, but not limited to, Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst or SOC Analyst. 

> **Pro tip**: You can also use the criteria you noted in the **Job Search Criteria** section of the elevator pitch template to filter for specific jobs. 

When you identify a role that appeals to you,  add its title and the company’s name to the Role section of the elevator pitch template.

### Step 4: Record your relevant experience and skills
Review the job description for the role you identified in Step 2. Think about how the experience, responsibilities, and skills required for the position align with your own experience and skill set. 

Consider experience or skills you gained from previous jobs, school, this program, volunteer work, and even your personal life. Record **at least 2-3** relevant experiences and skills in the **Relevant Experience and Skills** section of the template. 

### Step 5: Record information about the company
Describe what they do and what their mission is. You may find this information in the job description itself, or you might need to navigate to the company’s website. Read what others have to say about the company, as well.Conduct some pre-interview research about the company that is hiring for the role that you identified. 

Consider the following details while reviewing their information:

- What's their mission?

- What industry are they in?

- Are they a new company?

You might find this information in the job description itself.  Then, record **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** describing your findings in the **Company Description** section of the template. Note anything about the company that you find particularly interesting.

### Step 6: Start your pitch with an introduction
In the steps that follow, you'll draft an elevator pitch in the **Elevator Pitch** section of the template. 

Start with an introduction of **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** that includes your name and provides a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first job in cybersecurity, mention some of your previous jobs that had relatable or transferable skills.

### Step 7: Express your interest in the role
In an elevator pitch, it’s important to get to the point as quickly as possible. Write **1-2 sentences (20-40 words)** explaining why the role interests you and why you want to work in the industry.

### Step 8: Describe your relevant experience and skills
Next, review the relevant experience and skills you recorded in Step 3. In **2-4 sentences (40-80 words)**, highlight your experience and skills to communicate the value you would bring to the position. Describe the strengths you have that make you a good fit for the role. Consider mentioning your completion of this certificate program and other relevant coursework. And, if applicable, describe a particular project you worked on that relates to the requirements for the role. 

### Step 9: Communicate your interest in the company
Communicating why you are interested in the company helps show the interviewer that you are knowledgeable about the company and not just the role. Refer to the description of the company you recorded in Step 3. Then, write **1-2 sentences (20-40 words)** indicating that you understand the company’s mission and expressing your desire to work for them. 


### Step 10: Proofread and revise your draft
Once you’re done with your first draft, proofread and revise it. Set a timer and read your draft out loud to check if it fits within the 30–60 second limit. While checking to see it fits within that time frame, it’s also important not to talk too quickly. Talking too fast can make your elevator pitch hard to understand. If necessary,  edit it down. Remember, you want to be able to quickly deliver your elevator pitch and capture your audience’s attention. Reading your pitch out loud can also help you identify any awkward phrasing and refine your writing.
