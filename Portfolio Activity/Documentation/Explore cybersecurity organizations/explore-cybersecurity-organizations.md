# Activity: Explore cybersecurity organizations

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will identify the areas of cybersecurity that interest you most. Then, you will explore various cybersecurity organizations related to those interests and determine which ones most appropriately fit your interest and skill set.  

As you learned earlier, engaging with the security community through various security organizations and conferences is a great way to stay up-to-date on current security news. By staying informed about security trends, you can more effectively identify and develop remediation strategies to address a wide range of security challenges. Taking this approach can help you advance your career by familiarizing yourself with what’s going on in the security world. 

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario
Review the following background information. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

It’s a useful practice to find a security organization to join during the job searching process. Doing so will help you engage with the security community while you’re seeking employment.   

The first step in choosing a security organization you might like to join is to reflect on what areas in cybersecurity interest you most. After you’ve identified a few topics, the next step is to search for organizations related to those topics online. Once you’ve done research into a few different organizations that are relevant to your interests, it’s important to write what stood out to you and why. This will give you an opportunity to review your notes at a later time to help you determine which organizations  most closely align well with the areas in cybersecurity that interests you the most

### Step 2: Write down your cybersecurity topics of interest
In **Part 1** of the security organization worksheet, list your areas of interest in the cybersecurity profession. For example, these are some areas you might consider:

- Raising security awareness

- Protecting sensitive data

- Cloud security

You can include **at least three topics**, but you may include more if you like.  Typically two or three topics is ideal. That way, you can keep focused on a specific aspect of the security field. 

> *Note: Think back to the different security topics throughout this certificate program such as cloud security, incident response, forensic security, etc. You can also review a summary of topics discussed in each course on the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate main page]().*

### Step 3: Identify three security organizations and highlight their objectives

Spend some time researching security organizations online. Use keywords of the interests you previously listed to help with your search. For example, "data encryption organizations," or "vulnerability management." Pay close attention to the objectives and goals of the organizations you research and try to identify ones that align with the interests you identified in **Part 1** of the worksheet

Choose three organizations that align most closely with your interests. Then, add their **names** and **brief descriptions (20-40 words)** of their objectives to **Part 2** of the worksheet.

> *Note: Consider the “about us” page on the organization’s website. That typically will have mission statements and areas of focus for the  organization.*

### Step 4: Explain which organization fits your interest the most and why
In **Part 3** of the security organization worksheet, write **1-2 sentences (20-40 words)** explaining how each organization does (or does not) relate to your interests. Then, clearly identify one organization that most closely aligns with your interest and goals in cybersecurity. 

> *Note: Keep in mind that it's just as important to determine which organization does not fit your needs as much as it is to determine the organization that does fit your needs. Even though an organization may match your professional interests, it does not necessarily mean that organization is a good match for what you’re looking for.*

Be sure to include the following elements in your completed activity: 

- At least three cybersecurity topics of interest.
