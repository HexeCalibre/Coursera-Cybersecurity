# Activity: Filter malicious emails

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will analyze a suspicious email and identify signs of a phishing attack. Then, you will determine whether the email should be allowed or quarantined. 

Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering that you’ll encounter in the field. Identifying phishing attempts will help you prevent threats and find ways to improve security procedures.

## Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of Imaginary Bank. **Spear phishing** is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is being asked to install new collaboration software, ExecuTalk.

The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked you with investigating the message and determining whether it should be quarantined.

## Step-By-Step Instructions
Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity.

### Step 1: Analyze the suspicious email
Previously, you learned that phishing is a type of social engineering. Threat actors who send malicious emails rely on deception and manipulation techniques to trick their targets. When investigating suspicious emails like this, it's a good idea to note the threat actor's tactics. You can use that information to alert others at your organization about similar messages they might receive and what to watch out for.

Start your investigation by analyzing the suspicious message. Try to identify clues that this is a phishing attack against this executive at Imaginary Bank:

```

### Step 2: Examine the sender's information
Next, examine the major parts of this message in closer detail starting with the email header. You can often find clues in the message header that indicate you are dealing with a phishing attack.

Examine the email header of this suspicious message:

```
From: imaginarybank@gmail.org

Sent: Saturday, December 21, 2019  15:05:05

To: cfo@imaginarybank.com

Subject:  RE: You are been added to an ecsecutiv's groups
```
> **Pro tip:** Always check the domain name that comes after the @ symbol. Requests for sensitive information or asking you to download files should not come from personal accounts, like @gmail.com, @icloud, @yahoo.com or others.


1. Which two clues in the message header indicate to you that this is a phishing attempt? Select two answers.

[ ] The time stamp goes beyond 12PM.

[ ] The subject line appears to be a reply.

**[x] There is a misspelling in the subject line.**

**[x] The sender is using a different domain.**

### Step 3: Review the message body for clues

### Step 4: Investigate the download options
Phishing emails often contain links that redirect to malicious sites or trigger malware downloads.

> **Pro tip:** When investigating suspicious emails, hovering your mouse cursor over buttons will reveal the URL they redirect to without having to click them. This is the safest way to check if it will take you to a suspicious domain or if it links to an http:// URL that isn’t secure.

In this case, the message contains three download options. Each of them opens this login form:

![A login screen from the domain my.site.net/pwnexecs/. The login screen appears like an official ExecuTalk login screen.](/Portfolio%20Activity/img/a-login-screen-from-the-domain-my-site-net-pwnexecs-the-login-screen-appears-like-an-official-execu-talk-login-screen.png)
