# Portfolio Activity: Finalize your incident handler's journal

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you will finalize the incident handler's journal that you've been working on throughout this course. Then, you'll add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters.

You may recall that in [a previous activity](/Portfolio%20Activity/Documentation/Document%20an%20incident%20with%20an%20incident%20handler's%20journal/Incident-handler-s-journal-.docx) at the introduction of this course, you completed your first entry in your incident handler's journal. As you progressed through this course, you used your incident handlerâ€™s journal to apply your documentation skills and keep track of your learning journey. By now, you might have multiple entries in your journal. These entries would be valuable to add to your portfolio. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create your cybersecurity portfolio](/Foundation%20of%20Cybersecurity/Module%204/Create%20a%20cybersecurity%20portfolio.md).

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

## Step-By-Step Instructions
Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 5 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

#### Step 2: Review your journal entries
You might have multiple entries in your incident handler's journal. If your journal contains missing or incomplete entries, go back and review any previous sections of this course to add additional log entries to your journal. Here's a list of the course activities you can revisit to complete your journal:

- [Activity: Document an incident with an incident handler's journa](/Portfolio%20Activity/Documentation/Document%20an%20incident%20with%20an%20incident%20handler's%20journal/document-an-incident-with-an-incident-handler-s-journal.md)

- [Activity: Analyze your first packet](/Portfolio%20Activity/Lab%20Activity/Analyze%20your%20first%20packet/analyze-your-first-packet.md)

- [Activity: Capture your first packet](/Portfolio%20Activity/Lab%20Activity/Capture%20your%20first%20packet/capture-your-first-packet.md)

- [Activity: Investigate a suspicious file hash](/Portfolio%20Activity/Documentation/Investigate%20a%20suspicious%20file%20hash/investigate-a-suspicious-file-hash.md)

- [Activity: Use a playbook to respond to an attack](/Portfolio%20Activity/Documentation/Use%20a%20playbook%20to%20respond%20to%20a%20phishing%20incident/use-a-playbook-to-respond-to-a-phishing-incident.md)

- [Activity: Review a final report](/Portfolio%20Activity/Documentation/Review%20a%20final%20report/review-a-final-report.md)

- [Activity: Explore signatures and logs with Suricata](/Portfolio%20Activity/Lab%20Activity/Explore%20signatures%20and%20logs%20with%20Suricata/explore-signatures-and-logs-with-suricata.md)

- [Activity: Perform a query with Splunk](/Portfolio%20Activity/Lab%20Activity/Perform%20a%20query%20with%20Splunk/perform-a-query-with-splunk.md)

- [Activity: Perform a query with Chronicle](/Portfolio%20Activity/Lab%20Activity/Perform%20a%20query%20with%20Chronicle/perform-a-query-with-chronicle.md)

At minimum, you should have the following entries in your incident handler's journal:

- At least 4 dated and numbered journal entries, including:

    - 2 journal entries documenting an incident investigation using the 5 W's

    - 2 journal entries describing the use of a cybersecurity tool

Review your incident handler's journal and make any necessary changes. Here are some things to consider during your review:

- Errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling

- Missing, inaccurate, or incomplete journal entries

#### Step 3: Update your journal entries
Update the journal entries that record an incident investigation. 

In the **Description** section in a journal entry in your incident handler's journal, include a brief description of the entry (20-50 words). You can also identify which phase(s) of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle the incident investigation occurred in and why. As a refresher, the phases are: `Preparation`; `Detection` and `Analysis`; `Containment`, `Eradication`, and Recovery; and Post`-Incident Activity`. 

### Part 2 - Complete your incident handler's journal

#### Step 1: Write a reflection entry
Take a moment to reflect on your learning journey in this course so far. Copy and paste the following questions into the **Reflections/Notes** section in your incident handler's journal. Then, write a two to three sentence response (40-60 words) to each question.

1. Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?

2. Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed since taking this course?

3. Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?

## What to Include in Your Response
Be sure to address the following in your completed activity: 

- 4 completed journal entries, with the **Date**, **Entry**, and **Description** section filled in (50-80 words)

- 2 of the 4 entries document an incident investigation in the **The 5 W's** section (4-6 sentences or bullet points)

- 2 of the 4 entries outline the use of a cybersecurity tool in the **Tool(s) used** section (3-5 sentences or bullet points)

- The **Reflections/Notes** section addresses the reflection prompt (6-9 sentences or bullets)

> ***Note:** Some of these items may be addressed in the same journal entry. For example, a journal entry might contain descriptions about a cybersecurity tool and the 5 W's of an incident.*
