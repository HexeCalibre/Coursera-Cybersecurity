# Activity: Research network protocol analyzers

## Activity Overview
In this activity, you'll focus on the two network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump. Your goal is to gain a basic understanding of the Wireshark and tcpdump, how they work, and what their features are.

As you've learned, a **network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer)** is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. Network protocol analyzers help security analysts examine and understand the network traffic flows.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario
Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

In your role as a cybersecurity analyst, you have been asked to research the differences and similarities between Wireshark and tcpdump and create a chart that outlines your findings. 

## Step-By-Step Instructions
Follow the instructions and answer the question to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Access the template
To use the template for this course item, click the link and select *Use Template*.

### Step 2: Conduct online research
To begin, conduct online research to learn more about tcpdump and Wireshark. You can begin by using the official Wireshark documentation and tcpdump documentation: 

- [tcpdump - Resources and documentation]()

- [Wireshark - Official user guide]()

You can also perform an internet search to find resources that explain how these tools work. Try searching for information using these terms: 

- *Wireshark features and functionalities*

- *tcpdump features and functionalities*

- *comparison between tcpdump and Wireshark*

Be sure to critically evaluate the search results and select reliable and authoritative sources such as official documentation, reputable cybersecurity websites, or technical forums that provide accurate and factual information about the tools.

Explore these resources to gather information on tcpdump and Wireshark and focus on understanding the different features and functionalities that each tool has.

Consider these questions to help you compare the two tools: 

- What software or equipment is required to access and use the tool? Is the tool open-source or proprietary? 

- What type of user interface or layout does the tool use?

- How do security analysts typically use the tool? What are the recommended usage scenarios for each tool?

- How does the tool handle capturing, analyzing, and filtering network traffic?

- Are there any limitations or considerations for using this tool?

### Step 3: Fill in the diagram
After you've completed your research on Wireshark and tcpdump, fill out the template and include at least two features for each tool. These could be related to the tool's capabilities, the type of analysis they perform, contrasting features, user interfaces, usage scenarios, and any other notable distinctions. Then, include three similarities between tcpdump and Wireshark. 

## What to Include in Your Response
Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity: 

- **At least 2 differences** between Wireshark and tcpdump

- **At least 3 similarities** between Wireshark and tcpdump
