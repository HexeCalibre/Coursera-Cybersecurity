# Activity: Define and call a function

## Introduction
In this lab, you will open a notebook environment to practice defining and calling functions in Python. You’ll be presented with a security scenario to explore throughout the lab. You’ll define and call functions to automate a series of tasks.

## What you’ll do
You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Define and call a function that displays an alert about a potential security issue

- Define and call a function that iterates through a list of approved usernames and converts it into a string

## Introduction

As a security analyst, when you're writing out Python code to automate a certain task, you'll often find yourself needing to reuse the same block of code more than once. This is why functions are important. You can call that function whenever you need the computer to execute those steps. Python not only has built-in functions that have already been defined, but also provides the tools for users to define their own functions. Security analysts often define and call functions in Python to automate series of tasks. 

In this lab, you'll practice defining and calling functions in Python.

## Scenario
Writing functions in Python is a useful skill in your work as a security analyst. In this lab, you'll define and a call a function that displays an alert about a potential security issue. Also, you'll work with a list of employee usernames, creating a function that converts the list into one string.

## Task 1

The following code cell contains a user-defined function named `alert()`. 

For this task, analyze the function definition, and make note of your observations. 

You won't need to run the cell in order to answer the question that follows. But if you do run the cell, note that it will not produce an output because the function is just being defined here. 


```python
# Define a function named `alert()` 

def alert():
    print("Potential security issue. Investigate further.")
```

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

Take a look at the function above. ` def alert():` defines a function named alert. This means you're creating a reusable block of code that can be called later in your program to execute its instructions. The body of the function is `print("Potential security issue. Investigate further.")` It contains the code that will be executed when the `alert()` function is called. In this case, the print statement displays the message "Potential security issue. Investigate further." to the consol

</details>

#### **Question 1**
Summarize what the user-defined function above does in your own words. Think about what the output would be if this function were called.

define-and-call-a-function

## Task 2

For this task, call the `alert()` function that was defined earlier and analyze the output. 

Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.


```python
# Define a function named `alert()` 

def alert():
    print("Potential security issue. Investigate further.")

# Call the `alert()` function

alert()
```

    Potential security issue. Investigate further.


<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

To call the function, write `alert()` after the function definition. Note that the function can be called only after it's defined. 

</details>

#### **Question 2**
What are the advantages of placing this code in a function rather than running it directly?

reusability principle of DRY code

## Task 3

Functions can include other components that you've already worked with. The following code cell contains a variation of the `alert()` function that now uses a `for` loop to display the alert message multiple times.

For this task, call the new `alert()` function and observe the output. 

Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.


```python
# Define a function named `alert()`

def alert(): 
    for i in range(3):
        print("Potential security issue. Investigate further.")

# Call the `alert()` function

alert()
```

    Potential security issue. Investigate further.
    Potential security issue. Investigate further.
    Potential security issue. Investigate further.


<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

Task 3 is similar to Task 2 here. The difference is that a `for` loop is used to display the alert message multiple times.

</details>

#### **Question 3**
How does the output above compare to the output from calling the previous version of the `alert()` function? How are the two definitions of the function different?

The first function has a simple instruction meanwhile, the last function implement for loop statement that will generate output in 3 iterations.

## Task 4

In the next part of your work, you're going to work with a list of approved usernames, representing users who can enter a system. You'll be developing a function that helps you convert the list of approved usernames into one big string. Structuring this data differently enables you to work with it in different ways. For example, structuring the usernames as a list allows you to easily add or remove a username from it. In contrast, structuring it as a string allows you to easily place its contents into a text file.  

For this task, start defining a function named `list_to_string()`. Write the function header. 

Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code. Note that running this cell will produce an error since this cell will just contain the function header; you'll write the function body and complete the function definition in a later task.


```python
# Define a function named `list_to_string()`

def list_to_string():
```

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

To write the function header, start with the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function, parentheses, and a colon. 

</details>

## Task 5

Now you'll begin to develop the body of the `list_to_string()` function.  

In the following code cell, you're provided a list of approved usernames, stored in a variable named `username_list`. Your task is to complete the body of the `list_to_string()` function. Recall that the body of a function must be indented. To complete the function body, write a loop that iterates through the elements of the `username_list` and displays each element. Then, call the function and run the cell to observe what happens. 

Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.


```python
# Define a function named `list_to_string()`

def list_to_string():

  # Store the list of approved usernames in a variable named `username_list`

  username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza", "alevitsk", "wjaffrey"]

  # Write a for loop that iterates through the elements of `username_list` and displays each element

  for i in username_list:
        print(i)

# Call the `list_to_string()` function

list_to_string()

```

    elarson
    bmoreno
    tshah
    sgilmore
    eraab
    gesparza
    alevitsk
    wjaffrey


<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

The `for` loop in the body of the `list_to_string()` function must iterate through the elements of `username_list`. So, use the `username_list` variable to complete the `for` loop condition.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>

In each iteration of the `for` loop, an element of `username_list` should be displayed. The loop variable `i` represents each element of `username_list`. To complete the `print()` statement inside the `for` loop, pass`i` to the `print()` function call.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 3</strong></h4></summary>

To call the function, write `list_to_string()` after the function definition. Recall that the function can be called only after it's defined.

</details>

#### **Question 4**
What do you observe from the output above?

the for loop statement only run if the function was called

## Task 6

String concatenation is a powerful concept in coding. It allows you to combine multiple strings together to form one large string, using the addition operator (`+`). Sometimes analysts need to merge individual pieces of data into a single string value. In this task, you'll use string concatenation to modify how the `list_to_string()` function is defined.

In the following code cell, you're provided a variable named `sum_variable` that initially contains an empty string. Your task is to use string concatenation to combine the usernames from the `username_list` and store the result in `sum_variable`.

In each iteration of the `for` loop, add the current element of `username_list` to `sum_variable`. At the end of the function definition, write a `print()` statement to display the value of `sum_variable` at that stage of the process. Then, run the cell to call the `list_to_string()` function and examine its output.

Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.


```python
# Define a function named `list_to_string()`

def list_to_string():

  # Store the list of approved usernames in a variable named `username_list`

  username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza", "alevitsk", "wjaffrey"]

  # Assign `sum_variable` to an empty string

  sum_variable = ""

  # Write a for loop that iterates through the elements of `username_list` and displays each element

  for i in username_list:
    sum_variable = sum_variable + i

  # Display the value of `sum_variable`

  print(sum_variable)

# Call the `list_to_string()` function

list_to_string()
```

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

Inside the `for` loop, complete the line that updates the `sum_variable` in each iteration. The loop variable `i` represents each element of `username_list`. Since you need to add the current element to the current value of `sum_variable`, place `i` after the addition operator `(+)`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>

Use the `print()` function to display the value of `sum_variable`. Make sure to pass in `sum_variable` to the call to `print()`.

## Task 7

In this final task, you'll modify the code you wrote previously to improve the readability of the output. 

This time, in the definition of the `list_to_string()` function, add a comma and a space (`", "`) after each username. This will prevent all the usernames from running into each other in the output. Adding a comma helps clearly separate one username from the next in the output. Adding a space following the comma as an additional separator between one username and the next makes it easier to read the output. Then, call the function and run the cell to observe the output.

Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.


```python
# Define a function named `list_to_string()`

def list_to_string():

  # Store the list of approved usernames in a variable named `username_list`

  username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza", "alevitsk", "wjaffrey"]

  # Assign `sum_variable` to an empty string

  sum_variable = ""

  # Write a for loop that iterates through the elements of `username_list` and displays each element

  for i in username_list:
    sum_variable = sum_variable + i + ", "

  # Display the value of `sum_variable`

  print(sum_variable)

# Call the `list_to_string()` function

list_to_string()
```

    elarson, bmoreno, tshah, sgilmore, eraab, gesparza, alevitsk, wjaffrey, 


<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 1</strong></h4></summary>

Inside the `for` loop, complete the line that updates the `sum_variable` in each iteration. The loop variable `i` represents each element of `username_list`. After the current element is added to the current value of `sum_variable`, add a string that contains a comma followed by a space.

To complete this step, place `", "` after the last addition operator (`+`). 

</details>

<details>
  <summary><h4><strong>Hint 2</strong></h4></summary>

To call the function, write `list_to_string()` after the function definition. Note that the function can be called only after it's defined.

</details>
