# Activity: Explore signatures and logs with Suricata

## Introduction

In this lab activity, you'll explore the components of a rule using Suricata. You'll also have an opportunity to trigger a rule and examine the output in Suricata. You'll use the Bash shell to complete these steps.

## What you’ll do

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

* Examine a rule in Suricata
  
* Trigger a rule and review the alert logs

* Examine eve.json outputs

## Activity overview
Previously, you learned about packet analysis and the basic syntax and components of intrusion detection systems (IDS) signatures and rules. You also learned how to examine a prewritten signature and its log output in Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and network analysis tool.

In this lab activity, you’ll explore more about Suricata alerts and logs, including the general process of rule creation.

The Suricata tool monitors network interfaces and applies rules to the packets that pass through the interface. Suricata determines whether each packet should generate an alert and be dropped, rejected, or allowed to pass through the interface.

Source and destination networks must be specified in the Suricata configuration. Custom rules can be written to specify which traffic should be processed.

You’ll examine a rule and practice using Suricata to trigger alerts on network traffic. You’ll also analyze log outputs, such as a fast.log and eve.json file. This will help you understand some of the alerts and logs generated by Suricata.

Let’s get started with Suricata!

> ***Note:** The terms **rules** and **signatures** are used interchangeably in this lab activity.*

## Scenario
In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: **First**, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. **Second**, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the `fast.log` file. **Finally**, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard `eve.json` log file.

For the purposes of the tests you’ll run in this lab activity, you’ve been supplied with a `sample.pcap` file and a `custom.rules` file. These reside in your home folder.

Let’s define the files you’ll be working with in this lab activity:

- The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.

- The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the `sample.pcap` file.

- The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The `fast.log` file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The fast.log file can be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory after Suricata runs.The `fast.log` file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

- The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The eve.json file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.

When you create a new rule, you'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. You can use the `fast.log` file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the `sample.pcap` file.

It’s time to get started.

### Task 1. Examine a custom rule in Suricata
The `/home/analyst` directory contains a `custom.rules` file that defines the network traffic rules, which Suricata captures.

In this task, you’ll explore the composition of the Suricata rule defined in the custom.rules file.

- Use the `cat` command to display the rule in the `custom.rules` file:

```bash
cat custom.rules
```

> ***Note:** The `less` command can also be used to read file content one page at a time, making it useful for reading lengthy output.*

The command returns the rule as the output in the shell:

```bash
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```

This rule consists of three components: an **action**, a **header**, and **rule options**.

Let's examine each component in more detail.

#### Action

![]()

The **action** is the first part of the signature. It determines the action to take if all conditions are met.

Actions differ across network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rule languages, but some common actions are `alert`, `drop`, `pass`, and `reject`.

Using our example, the file contains a single `alert` as the action. The `alert` keyword instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches.

Note that the `drop` action also generates an alert, but it drops the traffic. A `drop` action only occurs when Suricata runs in IPS mode.

The `pass` action allows the traffic to pass through the network interface. The pass rule can be used to override other rules. An exception to a drop rule can be made with a pass rule. For example, the following rule has an identical signature to the previous example, except that it singles out a specific IP address to allow only traffic from that address to pass:

```bash
pass http 172.17.0.77 any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"BAD USER-AGENT";flow:established,to_server;content:!”Mozilla/5.0”; http_user_agent; sid: 12365; rev:1;)
```

The `reject` action does not allow the traffic to pass. Instead, a TCP reset packet will be sent, and Suricata will drop the matching packet. A TCP reset packet tells computers to stop sending messages to each other.

You’ll most often use the alert `rule` in this lab activity.

> ***Note:** Rule order refers to the order in which rules are evaluated by Suricata. Rules are loaded in the order in which they are defined in the configuration file. However, Suricata processes rules in a different default order: pass, drop, reject, and alert. Rule order affects the final verdict of a packet.*

#### Header

![]()

The next part of the signature is the **header**. The header defines the signature’s network traffic, which includes attributes such as protocols, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and traffic direction.

The next field after the action keyword is the protocol field. In our example, the protocol is `http`, which determines that the rule applies only to HTTP traffic.

The parameters to the protocol `http` field are $`HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic coming from the `$HOME_NET` and going to the destination IP address `$EXTERNAL_NET`.

`$HOME_NET` is a Suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` that you can use in your rule definitions as a placeholder for your local or home network to identify traffic that connects to or from systems within your organization.

In this lab `$HOME_NET` is defined as the 172.21.224.0/20 subnet.

The word `any` means that Suricata catches traffic from any port defined in the `$HOME_NET` network.

> ***Note:** he `$` symbol indicates the start of a variable. Variables are used as placeholders to store values.*

So far, we know that this signature triggers an alert when it detects any http traffic leaving the home network and going to the external network.

#### Rule options

![]()

The many available **rule options** allow you to customize signatures with additional parameters. Configuring rule options helps narrow down network traffic so you can find exactly what you’re looking for. As in our example, rule options are typically enclosed in a pair of parentheses and separated by semicolons.

Let's further examine the rule options in our example:

- The `msg:` option provides the alert text. In this case, the alert will print out the text `“GET on wire”`, which specifies why the alert was triggered.
  
- The `flow:established,to_server` option determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched. (In this instance, a server is defined as the device responding to the initial SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet.)
  
- The `content:"GET"` option tells Suricata to look for the word `GET` in the content of the http.method portion of the packet.
  
- The `sid:12345` (signature ID) option is a unique numerical value that identifies the rule.
  
- The `rev:3` option indicates the signature's revision which is used to identify the signature's version. Here, the revision version is 3.

To summarize, this signature triggers an alert whenever Suricata observes the text `GET` as the HTTP method in an HTTP packet from the home network going to the external network.

### Task 2. Trigger a custom rule in Suricata
Now that you are familiar with the composition of the custom Suricata rule, you must trigger this rule and examine the alert logs that Suricata generates.

1. List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder:

```bash
ls -l /var/log/suricata
```

Note that before running Suricata, there are no files in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.

2. Run `suricata` using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap` files:

```bash
sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
```

This command starts the Suricata application and processes the `sample.pcap` file using the rules in the `custom.rules` file. It returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.

> ***Note:** In this lab, using `sudo` is required to process packet capture files with Suricata, although it may not be required in a real-world environment.*

Now you’ll further examine the options in the command:

- The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
  
- The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the `custom.rules` file.
  
- The `-k none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

As a refresher, checksums are a way to detect if a packet has been modified in transit. Because you are using network traffic from a sample packet capture file, you won't need Suricata to check the integrity of the checksum.

Suricata adds a new alert line to the `/var/log/suricata/fast.log` file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met.

3. List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder again:

```bash
ls -l /var/log/suricata
```

Note that after running Suricata, there are now four files in the `/var/log/suricata` directory, including the `fast.log` and `eve.json` files. You'll examine these files in more detail.

4. Use the `cat` command to display the `fast.log` file generated by Suricata:

```bash
cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

The output returns alert entries in the log:

```bash
11/23/2022-12:38:34.624866  [**] [1:12345:3] GET on wire [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {TCP} 172.21.224.2:49652 -> 142.250.1.139:80
11/23/2022-12:38:58.958203  [**] [1:12345:3] GET on wire [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {TCP} 172.21.224.2:58494 -> 142.250.1.139:80
```

Each line or entry in the `fast.log` file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each alert line includes the message that identifies the rule that triggered the alert, as well as the source, destination, and direction of the traffic.

### Task 3. Examine eve.json output
In this task, you must examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the `eve.json` file.

As previously mentioned, this file is located in the `/var/log/suricata/` directory.

The `eve.json` file is the standard and main Suricata log file and contains a lot more data than the `fast.log` file. This data is stored in a JSON format, which makes it much more useful for analysis and processing by other applications.

1. Use the `cat` command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file:

```bash
cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

The output returns the raw content of the file. You'll notice that there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

2. Use the `jq` command to display the entries in an improved format:

```bash
jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less
```

> ***Note:** You can use the lowercase **f** and **b** keys to move forward or backward through the output. Also, if you enter a command incorrectly and it fails to return to the command-line prompt, you can press **CTRL+C** to stop the process and force the shell to return to the command-line prompt.*

3. Press **Q** to exit the `less` command and to return to the command-line prompt.

Note how much easier it is to read the output now as opposed to the `cat` command output.

> ***Note:** The `jq` tool is very useful for processing JSON data, however, a full explanation of its capabilities is outside of the scope of this lab.*

4. Use the `jq` command to extract specific event data from the `eve.json` file:

```bash
jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

> ***Note:** The `jq` command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (.`timestamp`), the flow id (`.flow_id`), the alert signature or msg (`.alert.signature`), the protocol (`.proto`), and the destination IP address (`.dest_ip`).*

The following is an example of the output of the command above. The `flow_id` is the long numeric field highlighted in orange in each row returned.

```bash
["2022-11-23T12:38:34.624866+0000",14500150016149,"GET on wire","TCP","142.250.1.139"]
["2022-11-23T12:38:58.958203+0000",1647223379236084,"GET on wire","TCP","142.250.1.102"]
```

5. Use the `jq` command to display all event logs related to a specific `flow_id` from the `eve.json` file. The `flow_id` value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. Replace `X` with any of the `flow_id` values returned by the previous query:

Image here...

```bash
jq "select(.flow_id==X)" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

> ***Note:** A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique `flow_id` to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same `flow_id`. This makes the `flow_id` field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.*
