# Activity: Practice writing Python code

## Introduction
In this lab, you will open a notebook environment to practice writing Python code. You’ll be presented with a security scenario to explore throughout the lab. You’ll become familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the `print()` function.

## What you’ll do
You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Learn about the capabilities of a notebook environment

- Write code comments in Python

- Display strings with the `print()` function

---

## Introduction
Python is a programming language that helps in automating instructions to the computer in a variety of contexts, including security contexts. Writing code in Python is a valuable skill that helps security analysts thrive in their technical work.

In this lab, you'll practice writing your first Python code while learning about a notebook environment. The hands-on practice you engage in throughout the labs will help you apply Python coding skills to your work as a security analyst. You'll benefit the most from the labs if you make sure to not only write in the cells that you're prompted to fill in, but also analyze all the cells thoroughly.

## Scenario
As a security analyst, you'll often use notebook environments and notebooks to write and run code. This lab will help you get familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments in Python, and displaying strings with the print() function.

In this lab, you'll complete a series of tasks that involve observing and running some pre-written cells of text and code, as well as filling in cells with your own text, Python code, and code comments.

## Task 1

The lab environment you're working in is a notebook-based coding environment. Notebooks, such as this one, consist of two types of cells: (1) text cells, also known as markdown cells, and (2) code cells.

Markdown cells allow you to write plain text and format it in the markdown language. Markdown language is used for formatting plain text in text editors and code editors. For example, you can use markdown to make headers, bold or italicize words, format text as code, add hyperlinks, and more.

For this task, write something into the following markdown cell. Be sure to replace the "[Double-click to edit this markdown cell and write something here.]" with your own text. When you have finished editing, press the Shift and Enter keys (or on some keyboards, the Shift and Return keys) to display your text.

## Task 2
In Python notebooks, code cells allow you to write code comments and code in Python.

To run a code cell, first place your cursor on the cell. Then, you can either click on the play icon, or press the Shift and Enter keys (or on some keyboards, the Shift and Return keys).

For this task, run the following code cell as is and observe the output.

## Task 3
Writing code comments is a way to document the intention behind code. It's a standard that analysts commonly use in their workflow. Writing comments that accompany code allows you to keep track of the technical decisions you've made in your project. This makes it easier for you and your team to read and revisit your code in order to understand what it does and why you took certain approaches.

For this task, run the following code cell as is and observe the output.

## Task 4

To type in a code cell, first click into the cell. Then you can write comments and code inside the cell.

For this task, add a comment at the beginning of the following code cell, describing what the code is doing. Write the comment to say `# This cell displays "I am using Python."`. Be sure to replace the `# YOUR COMMENT HERE` with your own comment before running the following cell.

## Task 5
In Python, `print()` helps you to display information to the screen.

For this task, use `print()` to display the message `"I am a security analyst."` by placing that message within the parentheses. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following code cell.

## Task 6
For this task, write a `print()` statement to display the string `"Python is useful for security!"` Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following code cell.

## Task 7
For your final task, you'll combine all the `print()` statements you've encountered and written in this lab up to this point, into one code cell.

Complete the following code with the remaining messages. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before running the following cell.
