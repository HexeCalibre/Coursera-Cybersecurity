# Prepare for technical interviews
You previously learned about the interview process, which generally consists of an introductory interview, a second interview with a hiring manager, and a panel interview. In this reading, you’ll focus more on the technical interviews that take place during the interview process. Although technical interviews can vary from one company to another, the concepts covered in this reading will help prepare you for any technical interview.

## What are technical interviews?
After you’ve applied for a job in cybersecurity and receive interest from a recruiter, you might be invited to an introductory interview, a second interview with a hiring manager, and a panel interview. Additionally, you might be asked to participate in a technical interview. The main difference between technical interviews and other interviews is the focus on required knowledge of specific tools.

## Python
Python is a programming language that serves as an important tool in security, and you might be asked about it during a technical interview. It will be important to mention your basic knowledge of Python. You might recall from this program that Python is popular for its ease of use as well as its extensive libraries and integrations. It can be applied to various security tasks that require automation. During your interview, you might be asked to whiteboard a pseudo code in Python. Being able to confidently use Python terminology during an interview can help you stand out as a potential candidate. This will let the interviewer know that you have a solid understanding of what Python is and what it can be used for.

## General techniques
During your technical interview, you might be expected to demonstrate basic knowledge of various general security concepts. For example, you might need to show familiarity with **security frameworks**, which are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. When discussing security frameworks, it would be helpful to mention your knowledge of specific NIST frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Another technical concept for you to discuss during a technical interview is network security. You might recall that **network security** is the practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. Reviewing the different technical concepts you’ve learned throughout this program is a good way to prepare for a technical interview. It will sharpen your skills and help you leave a good impression on the interviewer. 

Additionally, it may be a good idea to write the entire question down on paper before answering. Often, technical interview questions have multiple parts to cover. People sometimes rush to give an answer and show their knowledge but not fully cover everything that the question asks. Writing down the question can help you ensure you have the question right and are able to provide a structured response. 

## Possible technical interview questions
Every technical interview will be different, depending on the company and the interviewers. But here are a few possible technical interview questions to help you prepare: 

- What is the TCP/IP model?

The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. 

- What is the OSI model?

The OSI model stands for open systems interconnection (OSI) model. It is a standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network. 

- What are SIEM tools and what are they used for? 

SIEM tools are security information and event management tools that are used by security professionals to identify and analyze security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 

#### Key takeaways
> Technical interviews are a great opportunity to show your potential employer your technical cybersecurity skills, such as coding, during the interview. Even if you have no prior security experience, you can take this time to share what you’ve learned in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program and express your excitement to put that learning into action. By preparing for the technical interview process, you’ll be well on your way to building a career in cybersecurity.
